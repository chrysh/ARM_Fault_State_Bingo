# ARM Fault State Bingo

On ARM CPUs, prefetch or data abort exceptions resulting from invalid or unsuccessful access of memory can occur.
This bingo assembles some of them in a fun little game for the whole family!

The fsr info strings are taken from `arch/arm/mm/fsr-2level.c`.
You win if you can cross out a row, a column or a diagonal of four fields.
